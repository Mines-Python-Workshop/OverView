    "Loops are an important part of programming and will save you a ton of time. In python there are two different kinds of loops `for` loops and `while` loops. We will talk about each of them in a bit but first lets demonstrate their power. If you have a menial task or a calculation that is repetitive that is when you use the loop. Lets take an example. Say you needed the sum the squares of the first 100 multiples of 13 or represented mathematically $\\sum^{100}_{i=1} (3i)^{2}$ (This wouldlikely not come up for you but this is just an intorduction). This would be annoying to do by hand, but it is easily solved in just a four lines of python (I'm not counting comment lines)."

    "`for` loops are less powerful than while loops, but usually are much easier to implement.\n",
    "Ther above for loop has the following anatomy. you start a line with `for` so python recognizes you are writing a for loop. next is a variable `i` to hold items as you loop through them. The use of `i` is a common convention but the name of this variable can be anything and I would encourage using a better variable name to make your code easier to read. Then the kyword `in` is used. here we use the range function. the range function essentially generates a list of intigers starting with the first parameter, and then up to but not including the second parameter. This is then all followed up with a `:` and anything indented after the for loop is what happens during each loop each loop. To understand what is happening in this loop and how to track a loop lets keep track of what is happening for a few cycles."

We are waiting for the Remaining ammount of loan to be equal to or less than 0. `while` loops, rather than iterating through something, iterate until a condition is me. In this case it evaluates if `Loan_Remaining > 0`.

Feel free to edit the above code and play around with different values."

For the above example you could make the monthly payment of $20 which would not cover the interest of the loan. The loan would continue to grow and it would NEVER evaluate to 0 or anything less than 0. The while loop would go forever. Not Litterally though, your computer has limits. Sometimes it will crash, sometimes it will over heat, sometimes you get so tired of waiting you kill the program. These unintended outcomes from unanticipated inputs or values are called \"edge cases\". we can account for them and we will talk about how to handle them in the next section on conditionals."
