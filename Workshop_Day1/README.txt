Workshop Day1 Thurs 8/15
		Format:
			About 3 hours with a break in the middle where we walk participants through jupyter notebook tutorials
		Outcomes:
			Participants have exposure to opening different types of files and querying the data with numpy, pandas and/or polars (.csv, .xlsx, .txt, other?)
			Participants can handle common issues when loading data (numbers are read as strings, the header shifts file lines/indexing, etc)
			Participants can manipulate data by selecting rows or columns, converting data types, dropping nan values and performing basic numerical operations
			
			Participants can use os or glob to loop through their files and perform action
			Participants can plot data from different file types in a variety of plot styles (scatter plot, bar graph, line graph, etc) in matplotlib
