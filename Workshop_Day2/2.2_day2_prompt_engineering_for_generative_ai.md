# Python Workshop Day 2 
Welcome to the Chemistry Department Programming Workshop Day 2!  
   
These tutorials will focus on more advanced data analysis and visualization tools, and give some time for integration with your own data.
  
Day 2 consists of 4 sub-modules:  
* `2.0 Data Processing and Analysis` – statistical analysis, regression and smoothing  
* `2.1 Complex Formatting and Data Visualization` – using class strutures to access complex formatting 
* `2.2 Prompt Engineering for Generative AI` – how to write effective prompts for GPT and interpret the code it writes
* `2.3 Applications to Your Data` – try to apply workshop tools to you own datasets!

## 2.2 Prompt Engineering for Generative AI

Now that you've learned the basics, how can you use this information to write better prompts for Generative AI? How can you interpret the code it writes for you?


**Contents**  
  
In this module, you will cover:
 * [2.3.1 Prompt Engineering](#installing-python)
 * [2.3.2 Interpreting Code](#installing-a-package-manager)
