## Python Applications Examples  

- ebox_summary_plots
  - The program can be called from the command line and makes a single matplotlib figure summarizing the data from 4 different datafiles.  Whenever I run an MD simulation, this script automatically runs to make a summary plot. If there is an error, the script proceeds and writes an error message.  
- cube_to_html
  - This program can be called from the command line and convert a Gaussian *.cube file to an interactive *.html file. This visualizes molecular orbitals. Whenever I run a QM calculation, this script is called automatically to generate the MOs for the frontier orbitals.  
- hellman_feynman_figure
  - This notebook is an excerpt of a larger notebook I used to make figures for a presentation. Before creating the figure, I create a custom plotting function and configure my plot settings so that each panel is uniform. All of the panels are made in a single loop.
